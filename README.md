- [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
- **.NET Core SDK:** This application is built using ASP.NET Core, so you'll need the .NET Core SDK installed. You can download it from [Microsoft's official website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

- **Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio:** You can use either of these code editors to work with the application's source code.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the project in your chosen code editor.

3. In the `appsettings.json` file, update the connection string to point to your SQL Server instance. Modify the `"DefaultConnection"` connection string to match your server, database, and authentication details.

## Running the Application

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.

2. Run the following commands to create and apply the database migrations:

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update

Choosing ASP.NET MVC with Identity Architecture
===============================================

Introduction
------------

 For TechSolutions data management system, the decision was made to embrace the ASP.NET MVC with Identity architecture due to its compelling advantages in terms of simplicity, security, and extensibility.

1\. Ease of Development with ASP.NET MVC
----------------------------------------

ASP.NET MVC provides a clean and organized way to structure our web application. The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern brings a natural separation of concerns, making it easier to manage different aspects of the application. The simplicity of MVC aligns with our goal of creating a maintainable and scalable project.

2\. Built-in Identity Management with ASP.NET Identity
------------------------------------------------------

Identity management is a critical aspect of any web application. ASP.NET Identity comes to the rescue by offering robust and built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms. Handling user registration, login, and roles becomes a breeze, allowing us to focus more on building unique features rather than reinventing the authentication wheel.

3\. Security at the Core
------------------------

Security is non-negotiable, especially when dealing with user data and sensitive information. ASP.NET Identity employs industry-standard security practices, including password hashing, account lockout mechanisms, and multi-factor authentication. This built-in security layer provides peace of mind and saves valuable development time.

4\. Flexibility for Customization
---------------------------------

While ASP.NET Identity offers out-of-the-box solutions, it also provides the flexibility to customize authentication and authorization processes. This allows us to tailor identity management to our specific project requirements, ensuring a perfect fit for our needs.

5\. Integration with ASP.NET Ecosystem
--------------------------------------

ASP.NET MVC and Identity seamlessly integrate into the broader ASP.NET ecosystem. This integration opens the door to a vast array of libraries, tools, and resources that enhance development efficiency. Whether it's leveraging Entity Framework for data access or utilizing middleware for additional functionality, the ASP.NET ecosystem offers a rich set of possibilities.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, the decision to adopt ASP.NET MVC with Identity architecture stems from its combination of simplicity, security, and extensibility. This choice not only aligns with industry best practices but also empowers the development team to create a secure, scalable, and feature-rich web application. The ASP.NET MVC with Identity stack lays a solid foundation for our project, ensuring a smooth and efficient development journey.
